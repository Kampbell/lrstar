# lrstar

LRSATAR is parser generator written by Paul B Mann and hosted on http://lrstar.sourceforge.net This repo contains old versions of this parser generator which were published under BSD license. New versions of lrstar are commercial software and will not be added here.

There were some activity in this repo:
 * I've added C++11 reentrant parser skel-files. Currently they are broken from the C++ standard point of view but GCC compiles the code.
 * I've added CMake scripts to build, install and installation discovery on Linux.
 * I've added Arch Linux package generation.
 * I was playing a bit with the code trying to split automata tables calculation algorithm from IO and switch from EBNF to PEG but have not much time to finish this work.
 * https://github.com/zosrothko have added TBNF article from Paul B Mann and MSVS 2015 solution files.
