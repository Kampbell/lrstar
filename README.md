I'm not original author of this software but the main project page and sourcefourge
pages of the project are disabled and I can't contact Paul B Mann (original author)
to get the reason to stop this project. I decide to publish original code and my
modifications here since I feel that it's the best parser generater I've ever seen
and think that this project deserve to live.
